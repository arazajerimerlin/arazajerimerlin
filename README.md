## Hi there 👋

I’m a university student with a strong interest in design, technology, and building things from ideas.

I enjoy designing and creating anything that comes to mind—from small experiments to full projects. If an idea pops into my head, I usually try to design it, prototype it, and learn something new from it.

I’m currently focused on improving my skills through hands-on projects, experimenting with different tools, and exploring how design and technology work together. I may not have years of experience yet, but I’m always curious, motivated, and learning as I go.

Most of my work comes from:

Personal projects

University assignments

Experiments to understand new tools and concepts

Fun Facts:

My favorite anime is Hellsing and Bleach
I'm half Filipino and Cambodian but i cannot speak Tagalog
I have a voice assistant named Stark
Hobbies: Gaming, Gym, Coding, Reading....
